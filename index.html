      <p id="conclusion-description">Even Though Tohru Oikawa was just a supporting character of the story, I relate to him personally more than the protagonists. Because, growing up, I also didn't have any sort of special talents. I had to work hard for my achievements. So the portrayl of Tohru Oikawa really hit home. And it gives me courage and strength that no matter what difficult tasks life throws my way and it will, I will overcome them with what I have in the best way I can.</p>
